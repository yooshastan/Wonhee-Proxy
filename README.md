# Wonhee Proxy

**Alpha 0.2** · Independent Android proxy companion for Yooshastan Ultgram.

Wonhee helps you configure, save and hand off trusted MTProto or SOCKS5
endpoints to an installed Ultgram client. It does not host the proxy on your
phone, start a VPN or silently redirect Android traffic.

## What works in Alpha 0.2

- **Encrypted profiles:** Explicitly save up to 16 named configurations locally.
  The profile list (including any MTProto secret or SOCKS5 credentials) is
  encrypted as one authenticated AES-256-GCM document with a non-exportable
  Android Keystore key. No plaintext fallback or Android Auto Backup.
- **Two endpoints per profile:** A required public IP/DNS name and an optional
  home LAN IPv4 address, with one TCP port and credentials.
- **Endpoint choice:** Public, LAN (manual), or Auto. Auto selects the LAN
  address only if it is an RFC1918 IPv4 literal on the device's active Wi-Fi
  subnet and the active network is not reporting VPN transport. Otherwise it
  selects public. This is a convenience hint, **not authentication of your
  home network**. Check the displayed endpoint before importing.
- **TCP-only diagnostics:** An explicit consent dialog shows the selected
  host and port, then attempts a 4-second TCP connection. Reachability is
  separate from an authenticated MTProto or SOCKS5 connection.
- **Ultgram handoff:** Sends proxy data only through an explicitly package-
  scoped Android intent to known Ultgram variants, including the FOSS debug
  package com.yooshastan.ultmessenger.foss.beta. No generic chooser.

### Important limits

- Changing networks **does not silently switch an already active Ultgram
  proxy**. Auto selection applies only when you press Test or Open in Ultgram.
  After network changes, open Wonhee and re-import if needed.
- No VPN, system-wide ad blocker, encrypted DNS, background gateway,
  fail-closed routing, real protocol handshake test, or Navidrome access yet.
- No proof of anonymity or zero leaks. The proxy operator can see the client
  IP, and your Telegram account identity remains linked to you.
- Telegram-sponsored messages are delivered via Telegram APIs as required by
  client policy.
- Keystore encryption protects data at rest; it is not a defense against a
  compromised/unlocked phone or an attacker who can operate the installed app.
- Uninstalling Wonhee, changing its signing identity, or resetting Android's
  Keystore may make saved profiles unrecoverable. Keep your own credentials
  securely stored outside the app. Do not publish secrets in GitHub issues.

## How to try it

1. Build or download the wonhee-proxy-alpha02-debug-apk from GitHub Actions.
2. Install the APK (the CI debug signing key can change across workflow runs,
   so Android may require uninstalling an older debug APK first).
3. Enter a **Public server IP or DNS name**, port and secret. For your home
   server, optionally enter the private LAN address separately.
4. Choose Auto / Public / LAN. Tap **Test selected TCP endpoint** and read the
   confirmation. TCP success does *not* mean Telegram authenticated.
5. Tap **Open in Ultgram** and activate the imported profile there.
6. Give the profile a name and tap **Save / update encrypted profile**. Restart
   Wonhee, select the saved profile, and verify its fields reload. Test Public
   on cellular and Auto on your home Wi-Fi.
7. See [Alpha 0.2 manual test plan](docs/ALPHA02_TEST_PLAN.md).

Android SDK API 36, JDK 17, Gradle 8.13:

    gradle :app:assembleDebug

The repository also includes an optional MTProxy gateway starter and a longer
privacy/network roadmap. Do not expose your Navidrome HTTP port to the open
internet or remove Tailscale until a separate authenticated service tunnel
has been built and audited.
